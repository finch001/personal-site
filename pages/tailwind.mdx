title: Hi Adam! Hi Steve!

I'm Sergio, you can find me online as `sergiodxa` basically everywhere, most of the time I'm on [GitHub](https://github.com/sergiodxa) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sergiodxa).

I'm father of a 2 years old baby, named Salvatore, so I value a lot a sensible work-life balance, I live in PerÃº, one hour behind EST, nevertheless I'm originally from Argentina, I have even lived for two years in Colombia.

Related to the job, I would love to work building Tailwind UI, so far Tailwind CSS has helped me a lot on the projects I have used it, and if I can build a better experience for other developers that allow them to build greater products using Tailwind UI then I will be ideal for this job.

I have experience building a React-based Design System using Tailwind CSS. I think that experience could be really useful to build the official ones based on Tailwind UI designs and components. I haven't really used Vue but I have a general idea on how it works, and I believe I can learn it without issues, same for other tools like Alpine, Laravel or Jigsaw.

I have a lot of experience in Next.js, I was contributor in the first versions and worked at Vercel for over a year, I can help you with the migration of the docs to Next + MDX, I helped build the initial docs of the Vercel Design System and API, and with the development of any future project using them, even migrating the Tailwind UI app to Next.js too.

Last year, I teach Frontend development in a bootcamp, here in PerÃº, and I worked as Support Engineer at Vercel for a year before switching back to full-time Software Engineer, because of these I have a lot of experience teaching and helping others developers, and I could assist with any customer support, troubleshooting issues for users when needed, and creating teaching material for both Tailwind CSS and Tailwind UI.

I have been working fully remote for three years now, and because my timezone is similar to the EST, I could pair with you whenever needed.

While my main focus is on Frontend I'm used to learn whatever Backend technology are needed, so far I have worked with PHP and CodeIgniter, Python and Django, Serverless Node.js, and Ruby on Rails. I like Node.js more than the other options, because JS, also I'm using a lot of TS lately to build libraries.

I also love to write a lot about the things I learn, to share them with the community and as a public documentation of what I have learnt so far, most of my content so far is in Spanish, but lately I have been writing more in English and gradually I'm reaching the same amount of content in both languages, I even have a few about Tailwind CSS too ðŸ˜‰ you can find what I wrote on [my blog](<(https://sergiodxa.com/articles)>).

For all of those reasons, and what you could see in the landing below, I think I would be a great new member in the Tailwind team. I hope we could work together!
